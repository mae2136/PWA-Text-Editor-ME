## Description
  
This program was created by mae2136. If you have any questions on how this program works, please reach out to me at mae2136@gmail.com.

This project is just another text editor, this time by Miguel. It allows you to type in javascript style in the browser. Code was split into a client-server model, and has progressive web app (pwa) capabilities. It can also run offline with the use of a service worker, and stores data using IndexedDB.
